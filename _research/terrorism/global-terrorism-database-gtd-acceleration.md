PROJECT DETAILS
Abstract: 
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive, open-source terrorism database. It includes information on more than 190,000 terrorist attacks that have occurred worldwide since 1970. It provides a more complete understanding of the dynamics, causes and consequences of terrorism around the world, by allowing its users to analyze patterns such as the frequency of terrorist attacks, geo-spatial patterns of terrorist attacks, the lethality of terrorist attacks, patterns of casualties including injured persons and hostages, the emergence and prevalence of particular tactics and targeting strategies used in terrorist attacks, and the evolution of perpetrators of terrorist attacks. Led by START Senior Researcher Dr. Erin Miller, the GTD team will collect data through September 2019 and develop a new API (application programming interface) and other tools to accelerate data collection and delivery.
