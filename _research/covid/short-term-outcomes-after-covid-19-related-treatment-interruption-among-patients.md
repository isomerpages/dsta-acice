Purpose: To assess outcomes and recovery strategy of patients undergoing intravitreal
injections for exudative age-related macular degeneration who experienced COVID-19
related interruption in treatment during complete lockdown.
Methods: This was a retrospective, observational case study. We used a mixed effect model
with random intercepts to evaluate best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) accounting for
measured central macular thickness (CMT) and individual variability of each eye.
Furthermore, we analysed measures of the pigmented epithelium detachment as well as
presence of subretinal fluid and intraretinal cysts.
Results: We included 39 patients and we found a significant reduction in the BCVA between
the pre- and post-lockdown controlling for CMT. There was no significant difference in
pigmented epithelium detachment and in presence of subretinal fluid and intraretinal cysts.
Conclusion: We detected a significant loss in visual function. The magnitude of the average
loss was, however, limited suggesting good efficacy of the recovery strategy.
