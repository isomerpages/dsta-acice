**Frequently asked question (FAQ)** pages not only serve as a way for your audience to quickly find answers to the questions that they many have about your business or industry, but they also serve another important purpose – they can help your search engine optimization efforts.

FAQ pages have been gaining traction as a marketing tool again with the growth in voice search, mobile search and personal/home assistants and speakers. That’s because these types of search results usually rely on Google Answers and Featured snippets, which give succinct and informative results.

***An effective FAQ page:***

Reflects your audience’s needs

Covers a broad range of intent (transactional, informational, locational)

Is kept up-to-date as you get new data insights

Draws in new visitors to your website by solving problems

Drives internal pageviews to other important pages

Fuels blog (and deeper content) creation

Showcases expertise, trust, and authority within your industry

FAQ pages can be personalized to your business, while still providing valuable information that builds trust with your website visitors.
